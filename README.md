To set the right resolution for grub in etc/default/grub you have to:
   - Set GRUB_GFXMODE to 1920x1080 => GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080
   - Run sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
***
To use the default VSCode font, cascadia-code-fonts must be installed.
***
To restore the original GNOME settings if KDE overwrites them, install gnome-tweaks and go to:
      - Appearance > Icons
      - Appearence > Fonts
      - Appearence > Shell and Aplication Themes,
   and set them to "Adwaita".
   Also, all the preferred fonts should be Cantarell 12.

Pulseaudio (at least for me) didn't work as intended. The solution? Install pipwire. To do so:
````
sudo dnf remove pulseaudio pulseaudio-*
sudo dnf install pipewire pipewire-pulseaudio pipewire-utils
systemctl --user enable pipewire pipewire-pulse
systemctl --user start pipewire pipewire-pulse
pactl info | grep "Server Name" // to verify pipewire is running (the output should be PulseAudio (on PipeWire))
````

```
